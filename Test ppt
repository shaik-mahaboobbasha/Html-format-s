Workflow Overview

Step 1: Retrieve Data from the Main Table (MOR)

We are capturing the following fields from the MOR - Main Table:

MOR Number

Appcat Number

Appcat SLO Approval Status

SLO Approval Status CO

SLO Approval Status IR

Project Gate

MOR Origin

MOR ID

Engagement Type


Step 2: Retrieve Data from Dataverse Table

We are retrieving one specific field (SLM SLO Status) from the Dataverse Table named "MOR IDP SLM SLO Status Datas".

Step 3: Populate Excel Table

An Excel table is created with the range A1:J1, where:

Columns A–G and I–J are populated with the corresponding fields from the MOR - Main Table.

Column H is populated with the SLM SLO Status from the "MOR IDP SLM SLO Status Datas" table.


Initially, we retrieve all rows from the MOR - Main Table and insert them into the Excel table, excluding the SLM SLO Status field, which is fetched separately and inserted into Column H based on a matching key (e.g., MOR ID).
